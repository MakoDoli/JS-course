      global var is overwritten in blocks if redeclared with same name, while
      global let is not overwritten inside of block if redeclared with same name
    </p>
    <p>
      if let variable is declared inside block with "let" keyword, it is
      block-scoped and not accessible outside of block
    </p>
    <p>
      we can reasign global let variables inside block by using it without "let"
      keyword, just by variable name

      Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use.

    <p>
      var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and
      const are block scoped. <br />
      var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; <br />
      let variables can be updated but not re-declared; <br />const variables
      can neither be updated nor re-declared. <br />They are all hoisted to the
      top of their scope.<br />
      But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const
      variables are not initialized.<br />
      While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be
      initialized during declaration.
    </p>
    <p>
      var attaches new property (var name) to window object (not sure how and
      why), let doesnt
