        js has only one type of numbers (whole numbers, decimals (floats) - all
        are numbers)
      </p>
      <p>
        e - exponentiation - 10 times number after e. 2e3 = 2000, and with "-"
        2e-3 = 0.0002
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two main types of data in javascript - primitives and objects
      </p>
      <p>METHOD DOES something, PROPERTY IS something</p>
      <p>Javascript has built-in objects - global objects -date, math</p>
      <p>
        Primitives - numbers, strings and booleans - arent objects, but have
        built-in object counterpart, so numbers have access to the object with N
        (Number)
      </p>
      <p>
        numbers can not access built-in String object and its methods, as well
        as strings can not access built-in Number object and its methods
      </p>
      <p>
        Javascript number formatting methods return string, not number, so we
        need to convert them back to number
      </p>
      <p>Dont' do calculations with formatted numbers</p>
      <p>All JavaScript data types have a valueOf() and a toString() method.</p>
