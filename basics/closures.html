    <p>
      when we have a function defined inside of other function, inner function
      has access to the variables and scopes of the outer function, even if
      outer function finishes executing and those variables are no longer
      accessible outside of that function.
    </p>
    <p>
      In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at
      function creation time. <br />
      A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment
      within which that function was declared
    </p>
    <p>
      Javascript interpreter creates "closure" where variables and data of outer
      function are kept in 'heap memory', which lives longer than stack memory.
      Inner function has access to variables kept in heap memory
